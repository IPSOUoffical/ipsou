IPSOU Decentralized Trusted Search Value Intelligent Distribution Platform


On September 9, 2019, the 2019 Global Distributed Lightning Storage Blockchain Summit Forum officially closed at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Futian District, Shenzhen. IPSOU co-founder Peter Zhang was invited to the scene and made an important speech.  According to the understanding, this forum has attracted a large number of blockchain industry insiders and blockchain enthusiasts to jointly discuss and research the development plan of distributed storage technology and exchange opportunities for industry development.


The conference attracted Alain, global business director of TaurusChain, Polar Promoter/Starman CEO Liu Shiling, rudder CTO Li Bening, Homebloc CEO Dr. Joshua Peng, Tianzhu data CEO Zhang Zuoliang, Starball Technology Co., Ltd. CTO Song Weiguo, C CMO Thirteen, Chonghong General Manager Hong Longfa, Zhixiang Technology CEO Xiong Yurui, Yinxin Technology COO Huang Weihua, ONETOP Blockchain Rating Founder, IPFSGalaxy Technology Co-founder Yan Tao, Niu Chain CEO Guo Hong. Many large coffees came to the site to discuss the future of the distributed storage industry.


Coin World, Mars Media, World Chain Finance, Bundle Finance, Bit Vientiane, Future Finance, Chain to Finance, First Time, Ear Finance, Moon Finance, Ether Financial, Chain Tiger Finance and many other well-known media reported on the spot.


With the rise and development of big data and cloud computing technologies, global data is exploding every year, and data storage has become one of the most valuable resources in the world. Data storage is a foundation and key technology for future life. It is both an infrastructure for information retention and a core asset for building business models and forming specific products. With the idea of moving massive data into distributed storage systems, how distributed storage ensures data security and reliability, smooth experience and the formation of value ecology in people's lives in the future has become the prospect and expectation of distributed storage in this forum.


At the meeting, IPSOU co-founder Peter Zhang published a speech on the theme of "Building a Trusted Search Engine for Distributed Storage Networks". He said that the IPSOU search engine can solve the problem of distributed search applications. Traditional search engines use huge crawler technology to capture network data for profit, and the data brings about nearly hundreds of billions of value benefits to the giants, thus forming a monopoly. And such a search world driven by interests is obviously not what we want.


In order to solve this problem, IPSOU conducted a useful exploration and built a decentralized trusted search value intelligent distribution platform. IPSOU is a distributed search engine based on IPFS network. IPSOU can store all search data and user data permanently and securely in a distributed network.


 In order to make the data "trust" to the people, IPSOU has established a set of future search trusted mechanisms. First, review the consensus mechanism. The user system based on the search and evaluation under the DPOS consensus mechanism forms an overall community consensus on the authenticity of the results, avoiding the data under the centralized structure. Second, the data native mechanism. The data comes from the distributed storage network, and each search result corresponds to a unique hash value, thus ensuring that the data cannot be tampered and guaranteed to be unique.


At the same time, in the future, the search value is returned to the user, and the user is encouraged to behave positively. IPSOU constructs a trusted algorithm mechanism to judge the data uploading and content evaluation of the user in the distributed network, and realize the intelligent distribution of value. At the same time, the platform will evaluate the user's search behavior, and periodically distribute the advertising revenue to the user through the smart contract according to the interaction frequency of the user and the platform.


The concept of the IPSOU search engine is “Trusted Search World and Value Return” to realize the real application of technology and promote the ecological cycle of the community. Since its inception, IPSOU has been striving to create a decentralized trusted search incentive system and build a decentralized trusted search value intelligent distribution platform. For the ecological construction of the distributed storage search incentive system, we will work hard to innovate the wealth and glory of the era.


In the future, IPSOU will continue to exert its strength in the distributed field and maintain the orderly development of distributed search engines. In order to realize the unicorn-level application of the distributed storage search field--the trusted search IPSOU. In the future,we can work hard in a large-scale explosion in the commercialization stage. Thus, we have jointly completed the initial vision of a new generation of Internet portals!
