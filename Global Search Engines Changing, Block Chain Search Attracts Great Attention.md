In the past, block chain technology was mainly applied to virtual money, but its application scope is not limited to this. For example, a decentralized search engine based on block chain technology.

In fact, the impact of search engines on our lives is everywhere, and even determines the world outlook of contemporary young people, such as Google, Bing, Yandex and Baidu. But what are the business pains of today's centralized search engines?

Centralized search engine relies on "bidding ranking SEO" for profit, which lacks the essence of serving the public.

Centralized search engine information is not efficient and can not distinguish between professional users and traditional users.

From Baidu search, we can see that consulting information is more, and there is no complete introduction to EOS project, which is not very helpful for investment. Sogou browser is mainly advertising, such as Canon SLR, there is no concept of block chain. 360 search, from the results, is still the basic information, no meaning for investors.

Mainstream search engines monopolize information sources and non-neutral data control human world outlook

For users, they think the search results they get are trustworthy and unbiased. Therefore, search engines should be neutral. This may not be possible in a centralized search engine, because any search engine product we use today is essentially only providing an algorithmically generated "world view", it is only a slice or projection in the Internet world, not all. Users in centralized search engines can not decide whether to synchronize personal information, so they are forced to disclose privacy information.

More importantly, some of these alternative search engines themselves are very popular, and they don't seem very popular compared to the Google giants. Some of these alternative search engines look like ancient relics from the birth of the Internet.

The following is the most popular search engine in the world.

The World's Largest Search Engine: Google

**Global search engine market share: 78.23%**

Google is many times larger than all the other search engines in the world combined. Specifically, Google currently accounts for 78.23% of the global search engine market.

Today, Google is more than just a search engine. The company has developed many other software solutions, such as Google Drive. It has YouTube, has developed a series of smart phones and notebook computers, and even developed an autopilot. Google also supports other search engines, including Ask, which is the sixth largest search engine in the world.

Search engine giants are constantly updating their search engine results pages, and everyone hails the powerful Google.

Search Engine #2 Bing

**Global search engine market share: 8.04%**

Microsoft Bing is the second largest search engine in the world, with a market share of 8.04%.

Although Bing is smaller than Google, it still has considerable market share in many countries/regions. The search engine, owned and operated by Microsoft, originated from previous search engines MSN search and Windows Live search. Like Google, search engines filter search results into different tags, such as images, videos, maps and news.

Unlike Google, Bing's home page always features amazing images and news stories.

In July 2009, Microsoft and Yahoo announced an agreement in which Bing will support Yahoo's search engine, currently the fourth largest in the world.

Enterprises should not ignore this search engine. Although it has fewer users than Google, it still has 1.3 billion visits a month.

In addition, because most businesses and experts focus on Google, Bing is less competitive. So Bing ads and SEOs are certainly worth considering.

Search Engine #3 Baidu

**Global search engine market share: 7.34%**

Baidu, the third largest search engine, has a market share of 7.34%.

This search engine is the largest one in China. In fact, as of February 2019, Baidu had a 74.73% market share in China. By contrast, Google accounts for only 2% of China's search engine market.

Baidu was founded in 2000, headquartered in Beijing, the capital of China. It is one of the largest AI and Internet service companies in the world. That is to say, Baidu has little influence outside China.

Search Engine #4 Yahoo!

**Global search engine market share: 3.39%**

Yahoo ranks fourth in the world's largest search engine list, accounting for 3.39% of the global market share.

Yahoo's story is both interesting and embarrassing. The company was founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo.

Today, Yahoo's search engine is actually supported by Microsoft's Bing search engine. So the results of the two search engines are very similar.

Search Engine #5 Yandex

**Global search engine market share: 1.53%**

Yandex ranks fifth in the world's top ten search engines, with a global market share of 1.53%.

It is the most popular search engine in Russia, with 55% of Russian search traffic, followed by Google. Yandex search engines are also popular in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey. Yandex offers more than 70 different services, including tools such as Yandex Disk, a cloud-based storage service similar to Google's cloud-based hard disk.

As early as 2011, Yandex was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, with an initial public offering of $1.3 billion, making it the second largest company after Google.

Search Engine #6 AsK

**Global search engine market share: 0.72%**

Ask is the sixth largest search engine in the world, with a market share of 0.72%, 100 times smaller than Google and 10 times smaller than Bing.

The site was founded by Garrett Gruener and David Warthen in California in 1996, initially known as "Ask Jeeves". "My idea is not to create another directory or search engine, but a question-and-answer service, like a virtual portal."

In 2010, Ask abandoned the search engine market after facing insurmountable competition from more successful search engines like Google. Now, Google actually supports Ask.com search results.

Search Engine #7 DuckDuckGo

**Global search engine market share: 0.39%**

DuckDuckGo is the seventh largest search engine, accounting for 0.39% of the global market share.

This search engine is all about privacy. Today, there are countless Google privacy issues. As we all know, the giant Google can track, monitor and collect large amounts of data about its users. So if you're a little nervous about the data you collect and store, or you don't like targeted advertising, you might want to give DuckDuckGo a chance. The slogan of the DuckDuckGo search engine is "Privacy, Simplification".

It describes itself as "Internet Privacy Company, which enables you to seamlessly control your personal information online without any trade-offs." That sounds good, doesn't it? DuckDuckGo does not store your personal information or track your ads. There's even a handy Google Chrome browser extension that makes switching easier. Essentially, it is the perfect solution for anyone concerned about keeping personal information and browsing activities confidential.

DuckDuckGo now receives 27.4 million search queries a day and is growing.

Search Engine #8 NAVER

**Global search engine market share: 0.13%**

Naver, the eighth most successful search engine in the world, has a market share of 0.13%.

The popular Korean search engine has a 75% market share in Korea. Therefore, it is often referred to as "Korea's Google".

Naver was the first portal site in Korea to develop and use its own search engine in 1999. Today, Naver offers a variety of services, such as e-mail clients, encyclopedias and news portals.

**Search Engine Gold Award: IPSOU**

IPSOU may not be one of the most popular search engines in the world, but it is worth mentioning.

The Chinese name of IPSOU is Abisou. The search engine is based on IPFS distributed technology and block chain technology, spanning four frontier areas: A (AI artificial intelligence), B (Blockchain block chain), S (Search Algorithms search algorithm), D (Distributed Distributed Distributed) ABSD, allowing users to add hash tags and search for massive files on file systems.

This means that you can contribute to Web 3.0 by using only IPSOU search engines.

According to the official information of IPSOU, IPSOU is a distributed storage network based on IPFS file transfer protocol, which stores all search data and user data permanently and safely in the distributed network. IPSOU is committed to building a decentralized and trusted search incentive system. Using the combination of advanced technology solutions such as AI, search algorithm, block chain and distributed storage, a decentralized trusted search value intelligent distribution platform is constructed to return the search value to users.

Like DuckDuckGo, IPSOU focuses on privacy. This search engine will not store your search records, use external tracking tools or sell your data to advertisers. Your search is encrypted. More importantly, IPSOU is based on block chains to make it transparent and trustworthy.

Summary:

The list of the world's top ten search engines is likely to change in the next few years. Although one thing seems quite certain: Google will have a long and productive rule. To sum up, according to the global market share, here is the list of the top ten search engines in the world as of January 2019:

If you are a heavy user of Google or Baidu, would you consider using other search engines such as Bing, DuckDuckGo or IPSOU?
