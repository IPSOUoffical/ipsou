Disclaimer: This document is the mining instructions for IPSOU test network and the expected return on revenue.

In order to ensure the stable operation of IPSOU mainline, speed up the recruitment of super nodes and the construction of IPSOU community, the IPSOU Foundation (hereinafter referred to as the Foundation) will test and run the test network, and introduce an incentive mechanism for miners participating in the test network.


**Ⅰ. Certificate Mining of Test Networks**

The Foundation launched IPC for testing network ecology integral during network testing and mining. The integral is mainly applied to the incentive to contribute to the super nodes and mining work during the testing network, through which the stable operation of the network during network testing can be guaranteed. During the test network, the super nodes and miners who access the test network will receive corresponding IPC awards through the execution of intelligent contracts.

At the same time, in order to encourage miners to participate actively in the testing and mining of the main network, the Foundation allocated a certain number of IPSO to be used as incentives during network testing. For miners participating in network testing, intelligent contracts will automatically execute the sending of IPSO to the miners'wallet address according to the working conditions of the miners' equipment.

After the main line, the Foundation will use the IPC produced during the IPSO full repurchase network test. The specific conversion ratio will be announced on the main line before the official website.


**Ⅱ. Mining Rules and Exit Mechanisms for Network Testing**

1. IPSOU is the first brand of global block chain search engine. Search and storage are the two most important components of IPSOU technology architecture. Because of the difference of the performance requirements of storage equipment for miners with different service functions, the storage servers with different configurations correspond to the expected mining benefits for the storage miners and enterprise search miners.

2. In the whole IPSOU storage system, the maximum allowable storage space of 1% is used for non-pledge mining, and the benefits of non-pledge mining are allocated to the miners and foundations according to the ratio of 1:4.

3. Any miner shall participate in the mining of the super-node, and 10% of the mining income shall be allocated to the super-node, all of which shall be used for the promotion of the super-node and the recruitment of new miners.

4. Miners'earnings are released every day. When miners withdraw from mining, they must submit a written application to stop the earnings immediately after they pass the test. At the same time, in order to smooth the network transformation and operation, the storage equipment of the withdrawing miners must continue to operate within 15 days after the earnings stop, otherwise, the cumulative offline time will be more than 3 days during the test period. All pledged money will be deducted.

5. For the application of super-node, refer to IPSOU Super-node Global Recruitment Plan.

6. Mining capacity of storage network releases 0.2P in the first batch, and the release period is half a month. Later released in 2 batches per month.

7. During network testing, the maximum storage capacity of test storage devices is 4T.

**Ⅲ.Expected Benefits of Network Test Mining**

**1. Storage miners**

In order to test the network storage and storage service performance, the Foundation recruits storage equipment miners with corresponding configuration performance worldwide to participate in storage mining. Any storage miner who satisfies the requirements of participating in the network test mining can access the test network and receive IPC mining benefits and IPSO awards from the Foundation. The benefits are generated daily.


**Basic requirements for storage mining:**

Mining Method: Testing Network Storage Mining

Server Requirements: Memory Server for Memory Performance Configuration

CPU requires :Intel G5400 (3.7MHz, dual core, four threads)

Maximum Supported Hard Disk Capacity (T): 4T

Minimum Hard Disk Capacity (T) :1T

Bandwidth Requirements: Over 1M

Number of IPSO per T Mortgage: 15 IPSO


**IPC Expected Benefits for Storage Miners:**

Mortgage T-Number Range:4T

Expected daily average IPC output:25-40 IPC/day

The amount of output depends on the size of the mortgage storage space (T), online rate, network stability and credit loyalty.


**IPSO expected output of storage miners:**

Mortgage T Number:4T

Expected daily IPSO output:1-3 IPSO


**2. Searching miners**

In order to test the search performance of web search engines, the Foundation recruits enterprise-level storage servers with corresponding configuration performance to participate in the whole test network mining.

Search miners will be composed of professional enterprise storage service providers and search miners. Enterprise-level search servers will be provided by professional software and hardware support providers that meet the corresponding configuration performance, while using their professional software and hardware technology and equipment. Super nodes and their recommended miners should use professional software and hardware technology and equipment with corresponding configuration performance, and the number of miners excavated varies with different configuration performance.


**Basic requirements of search mining:**

Mining Method: Test Network Search Mining

Server requirements: Memory Server for Search Performance Configuration

CPU requirements: Intel G5400 (3.7MHz, dual core, four threads)

Maximum Supported Hard Disk Capacity (T): 4T

Minimum Hard Disk Capacity (T): 1T

Bandwidth Requirements: Over 2M

Number of IPSO T Mortgage: 25 IPSO


**IPC Expected Benefits for Searching Miners:**

The estimated daily average IPC output of 200-600 IPC/day depends on online rate, network stability and credit loyalty.


**IPSO expected output of 4-position search miners:**

Mortgage T number: 4T

CPU requires: Intel G5400 (3.7MHz, dual core, four threads)

Expected daily IPSO output :8-35 IPSO


**IPSO expected output of 12-position search miners:**

Mortgage T number: 4T

CPU requirements: Intel I3 8100 (3.6MHz, four-core, four-threaded)

Expected daily IPSO output: 20-60 IPSO


**Actual data of internal measurement:**


**Quantity of measured output of 4-position search miners:**

Mortgage T number: 4T

CPU requirements: Intel G5400 (3.7MHz, dual core, four threads)

IPSO output day: 34.2 IPSO


**IPSO measured output of 12-position search miners:**

Mortgage T number: 4T

CPU requirements: Intel I3 8100 (3.6MHz, four-core, four-threaded)

IPSO output day: 47.6 IPSO

Note: The above measured data are for reference only. The specific output depends on the environment in which the storage device is located, depending on factors such as online rate, network stability and credit loyalty.

* Credit loyalty, as an important parameter of assessment, has a great impact on mining revenue. The initial value of this parameter is 0.05, and the next day's online rate is 100%, increasing by 0.05 per day until 20 days to 1. Trust loyalty is recalculated from 0.05 on any day when the online rate is less than 90% during online operation.

Note: The mining methods of storage miners and search miners participating in the test network refer to the network management rules, which will be published on the official website www.ipsou.vip


**IV. Test Network Mining Time**

**IPSOU officially opened test network mining on August 20, 2019.**

The mining time of IPSOU test network will last until the fourth quarter of 2020, depending on the stability of the whole network test period and the development progress of the main network. The completion time of the test network mining will be announced one month before the IPSOU main line, and the official exchange ratio and repurchase plan between IPSO and IPC will be launched.
