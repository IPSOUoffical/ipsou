Question 1: Does digging IPSO have requirements for hard drives?

Answer: Yes,IPSOU mining has certain requirements on the hard disk.The hard drive is at least monitor level or enterprise level. Please choose to use the products of famous brand manufacturers. It is recommended to use 4T hard disk with high cost performance.

Question 2: Does tapping IPSO require a network?

Answer: Gigabit IDC room optical fiber network is recommended as the first choice. Single computer should allocate at least 2M of upstream broadband. Home bandwidth is not recommended.


Question 3: Does IPSO require CPU and memory?

Answer: CPU and memory requirements are not high, the general household level can support mining. However, for professional miners, it is recommended to use multi-core and multi-threaded processors and high memory. Intel G5400 (3.7MHz, dual-core and four-threaded) or more is required.


Question 4: What is the best mining system for IPSO?

Answer: Priority should be given to using Linux customized systems, such as the mining system developed by IPSOU's core strategic partner Galaxy Cloud, which not only has high security and rich functions, but also has better software system support and service details in the later period, with more guaranteed benefits.


Question 5: What is the difference between storing miners and searching miners in IPSOU mining rules?

Answer: Storage miners can only provide basic data resources for searching IPSOU network, which is equivalent to the porter of mechanical assembly line operation.
In addition to providing basic data resources for the network, the search miners also need to complete the task of searching and enriching basic data resources. They can not only actively provide data resources that can not be searched by the current network for IPSOU network, but also help to meet the real needs of users. At the same time, the required performance of the miners is slightly different, and the search miners need to have the requirements of professional equipment.
Mining returns for searching miners and storing miners are also slightly different.


Question 6: What are the differences between IPSOU storage miners and IPFS storage miners?

Answer: The storage miner of IPSOU is the basic data source of IPSOU search engine, which provides a large number of data resources. IPFS storage miners are the basic storage resources of IPFS distributed storage network. They provide a large amount of storage space, which is fundamentally different from each other.


Question 7: What is the difference between searching miners in IPSOU and searching miners in IPFS?

Answer: IPFS search miners complete the task of finding out the fragments of files users need in the IPFS network and transmitting them to users.
IPSOU's search miners accomplish the following tasks:
1. Transfer basic data to IPSOU network;
2. To upload data that users can not search in the current network to IPSOU network;
3. The last step is to present the data in the network to users.


Question 8: Does the money mined by IPSOU need to be locked?

Answer: Without locking the warehouse, miners can decide their own profits from mining.
1. It can be placed in the wallet, which greatly improves the profit coefficient of mining behind the mining machine bound by the wallet.
2. Transactions can be exchanged through exchanges.


Question 9: How will the network disconnect when miners store data?

Answer: When the storage data network is disconnected, the task can not be completed, and the corresponding information can not be found when the user visits, which affects the user experience. So network disconnection will not only affect the benefits of miners, but also affect the credit loyalty coefficient of users, and then affect the benefits of users.


Question 10: Is there a penalty mechanism for IPSOU mining?

Answer: Yes, when IPSOU starts mining test, the implementation of mining mortgage mechanism is to protect the security and reliability of data stored by users of IPSOU network, avoid miners withdrawing at will after joining IPSOU network mining, and affect the user experience of the prevention mechanism.
