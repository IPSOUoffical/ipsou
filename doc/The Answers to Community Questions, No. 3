Dear community members, we have received some questions from users in some communities, and give the following answers to some important questions:

Q1. What is IPSOU?
A: IPSOU is a search engine based on IPFS distributed storage network; it is committed to building a decentralized trusted search incentive system. Using the combination of frontier AI, search algorithm, block chain and distributed storage technology solutions, a decentralized trusted search value intelligent distribution platform is constructed. It stores all search data and user data in the distributed network permanently and safely, and uses the consensus mechanism and incentive mechanism of block chain. The system provides incentives and fair distribution rules for the builders and participants of the whole ecosystem, promotes the development of the industry and creates greater commercial value.

Q2. IPSOU development planning timeline?
A: --2018.11-2019.3: Search Engine Algorithms Development, Intelligent Contract Development Test, EOS Grafting Development
--2019.4-2019.6: Get support from hardware technical support, test mining start-up, search engine start whole web crawler, search incentive layer development completed
--2019.7-2.19.12: Search engine PC officially launched, search engine DAPP development completed, user search mining test started, AI word sense recognition development completed
- 2020.1-2020.5: Architectural Development of Atlas Search Engine and User Experience Iteration

Q3. What is the incentive distribution mechanism?
A: IPSO is a kind of passport under the IPSOU search engine ecology, which encourages the eco-builders and links all users in the ecology.
The total number of IPSO issuances is 2 billion. Participants can acquire IPSO by automatically providing different resources (storage space, computing power, content, etc.) after purchasing storage devices. IPSOU provides 70% of the total IPSO (1.4 billion IPSO) to encourage users to build an IPSOU ecosystem.

Q4. How about IPS0 generation mechanism?
A: IPS0 serves as an incentive reward for the participants who meet the incentive conditions by combining the storage files with the distribution of storage tasks. On the one hand, the number of IPS0 depends on the configuration parameters of the storage devices provided; on the other hand, IPS0 is distributed to participants according to the comprehensive efficiency of storage services such as storage file size, online rate, downlink bandwidth and operation and maintenance services.

Q5. IPSOU engine can solve the problem?
A: The new generation of search engines is Decentralized Search. The first step is to clarify the ownership of data and solve the problem of unethical data grabbing. Then it will become a real weighty stirrer in the online advertising market and bring new forms of online advertising. Finally, a clear Token economic model to create a strong and incomparable community of interests. IPSOU makes use of block chain technology and sharing mode to build a decentralized trusted search incentive system, so as to provide users with high reliability, strong security and low cost storage services.
