Question 1: Is there a requirement for the CPU and memory for mining IPSO?
A: The CPU and memory requirements are not high. Generally, the household level can support mining. If you need more revenue, it is recommended to use professional-grade multi-core processors and high-memory mining machines.

Question 2: Is there a requirement for mining IPSO for the network?
A: The online time and bandwidth of the network will determine the revenue of mining. It is recommended to use more than 5M bandwidth, preferably peer-to-peer professional bandwidth.

Question 3: What is the incentive mechanism for IPSOU?
A: IPSOU is the first brand of global block chain search engine. In order to maintain the healthy development of IPSOU search engine ecosystem, IPSOU Foundation issued 2 billion IPSO incentive certificates. IPSOU rewards behaviors that contribute to the construction and maintenance of the IPSOU search engine ecosystem by establishing an incentive layer. Current exchange price: 1IPSO = 0.4545 USDT

Question 4: What are the basic requirements for IPSOU test network search mining?
A： Basic requirements for search mining:
Mining Method: Test Network Search
Mining Server requirements: Memory Server for Search Performance Configuration
CPU requirements: Intel G5400 (3.7MHz, dual core, four threads)
Maximum Supported Hard Disk Capacity (T): 4T
Minimum Hard Disk Capacity (T): 1T
Bandwidth Requirements: Over 2M
Number of IPSO T Mortgage:25 IPSO

Question 5: How to become a search miner ?
A：In order to test the search performance of web search engines, the Foundation recruits enterprise-level storage servers with corresponding configuration performance to participate in the whole test network mining. Search miners will be composed of professional enterprise storage service providers and search miners. Enterprise-level search servers will be provided by professional software and hardware support providers that meet the corresponding configuration performance, while using their professional software and hardware technology and equipment. Super nodes and their recommended miners should use professional software and hardware technology and equipment with corresponding configuration performance, and the number of miners excavated varies with different configuration performance.

Question 6: For search mining, how many IPSOs can you mine in one day?
A: (1) IPSO expected output of 4-position search miners:
Mortgage T number: 4T
CPU requires: Intel G5400 (3.7MHz, dual core, four threads)
Expected daily IPSO output :8–35 IPSO
(2) IPSO expected output of 12-position search miners:
Mortgage T number: 4T
CPU requirements: Intel I3 8100 (3.6MHz, four-core, four-threaded)
Expected daily IPSO output: 20–60 IPSO

Question 7: How does the storage miner work?
A: Storage miners — that is, provide idle hard disk space and access the IPSOU ecosystem. The IPSOU ecosystem data storage market needs miners to contribute to the hard disk storage space. The harder the hard disk space, the higher your mining capacity. The storage market uses proof of workload, named POS (Power of Storage) certification.

Question 8: What are the basic requirements for storage mining?
A: Basic requirements for storage mining:
Mining Method: Testing Network Storage
Mining Server Requirements: Memory Server for Memory Performance Configuration CPU Requirements :Intel G5400 (3.7MHz, dual core, four threads)
Maximum Supported Hard Disk Capacity (T): 4T
Minimum Hard Disk Capacity (T) :1T
Bandwidth Requirements: Over 1M
Number of IPSO per T Mortgage:15 IPSO

Question 9: For storage mining, how many IPSOs can you mine in one day?
A:IPSO expected output of storage miners:
Mortgage T Number:4T
Expected daily IPSO output:1–3 IPSO
