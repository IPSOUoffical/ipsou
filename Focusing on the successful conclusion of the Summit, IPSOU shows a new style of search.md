The head of China Software Industry Association Block Chain Branch said that as a subversive technology, Block Chain is leading a new round of global technological and industrial changes. It is expected to become the "source" of global technological innovation and mode innovation. Promote the transition from "information internet" to "value internet".

At the meeting, many industry cafes exchanged collisions, shared views, shared the results of the development of the block chain, and will conduct in-depth cooperation and exchanges with more industry colleagues in the block chain!

At the conference, Zhang Ping, the co-founder of IPSOU, deeply talked about the construction and construction of IPSOU search engine, and discussed it from four aspects: search consensus mechanism, data can't be tampered with, user's positive behavior incentive, and 100% return of advertising revenue to users, so as to realize a decentralized and trusted search value intelligent distribution platform.

In the future, in the area of block chain distribution, IPSOU will spare no effort to build block chain infrastructure construction and build a brand new block chain search ecological platform!

On the evening of August 11, 2019, IPFS Galaxy Night with the theme of "Future Search and Galaxy Win-win" was held on the 6th floor of Sheraton Hotel, Greater China, Shenzhen. This event, hosted by IPFS Galaxy Technology and IPSOU, invites many top investment institutions and media from home and abroad to talk about the challenges and vitality of distributed large data storage and new search engines.

In 2018, as the first year of block chain, all kinds of block chain projects have sprung up. With the continuous innovation of block chain technology and the continuous expansion of commercial applications, block chain is profoundly affecting the transformation, upgrading and value reengineering of traditional industries such as finance, telecommunications, transportation and logistics, energy, medical health, law, manufacturing, etc., and is still in the pipeline. The digital economy is playing a more important role.

At the beginning of the banquet, IPSOU co-founder Zhang Ping gave a banquet speech: Seeking great development plans, insights into future search progress and innovation. The goal of IPSOU search engine is "letter search world, value return", realizing the real landing of technology application and promoting community ecological cycle; creating the first brand of global block chain search, protecting data rights and interests, data privacy, search value returning to users'search engine, promoting the birth of new Internet search mode; and adhering to it. The concept of "consensus, co-construction, co-governance and sharing" promotes global ecological construction.

Since its birth, IPSOU has devoted itself to creating a decentralized and trusted search incentive system. The system is based on distributed storage network and constructs network data storage and search services. To this end, IPSOU will initiate the super-node construction plan of distributed storage network. It intends to recruit 121 super-nodes in phases worldwide to participate in the construction and maintenance of the whole distributed network.

IPSOU Super Node Global Recruitment Program Phase I opens 21 Preparatory Super Nodes to apply for places. Any individual or institution that meets the requirements for participation will be made public online after the application is approved. IPSOU will also grant super-nodes a series of rights and interests, rewarding IPSOU contributors.

Nowadays, the campaign for IPSOU super-node has been launched. As IPSOU super-node, it will play an important role in their respective fields. It will take part in the construction of IPSOU ecology and community from the aspects of technology, talents, users and funds, and provide a solid foundation for the prosperity of IPSOU ecology and the large-scale outbreak of unicorn-class applications in the commercialization stage. Backing up, so as to jointly complete the initial vision of a new generation of Internet access.

‚Äù With the help of this conference, IPSOU will convey the development concept and business model of IPSOU to the industry. At the same time, IPSOU will start to carry out diversified cooperation with many participating organizations and move forward hand in hand. Thank you for your recognition and support of IPSOU. With your company on the way forward, IPSOU will be more confident, more motivated and more valuable. We look forward to your alliance in the future.
