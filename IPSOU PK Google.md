*IPSOU is a Weakly Centralized Search Engine---Google's Strongest Rival*
------------------------------------------------------

The current negative news about Google continues. First, Google faced the first GDPR survey of the Irish privacy regulator, followed by an antitrust investigation by the US Department of Justice on its search business and other aspects of the company. This proves that there are many problems in the way of centralization.

The IPFS, which was born in 2014, has been in operation for nearly five years and its popularity is obvious. Unlike Google, IPFS is a decentralized distributed storage system, and there are many projects based on IPFS development. The more famous ones are PSOU, LibP2P, and Multiformats.

What are the Differences Between IPSOU, LibP2P, and Multiformats?
---------------------------------------------------------

IPSOU is a distributed search engine based on IPFS. It allows users to quickly search for files on IPFS and find the data what they need.At the same time, users can participate in mining and get tokens. IPSOU is known as the blockchain version of Google.
Mutiformats is a collection of hash encryption algorithms and self-describing methods. It has six mainstream encryption methods, such as SHA1\SHA256 \SHA512\Blake3B, to encrypt and describe the generation of node ID and fingerprint data.
LibP2P can help developers quickly establish an available P2P network layer in the face of various transport layer protocols and complex network equipment.

IPSOU deserves to be focused!
---------------------------------------------------------

IPSOU is a search engine based on the IPFS distributed storage network, which is dedicated to creating a decentralized and reliable search system.IPSOU builds a decentralized trusted search value intelligent distribution platform through the perfect combination of artificial intelligence, search algorithm, blockchain and distributed storage technology solutions. IPSOU permanently and securely stores search data and user data in a distributed network. IPSOU creates greater business value for the development of the industry.

【IPSOU as a search engine can quickly search massive files】
---------------------------------------------------------

IPSOU uses the unique decentralization and distributed design of the blockchain, unlike the centralized server to steal users’ privacy. In the IPSOU system, data requests and transmissions are hashed all the way, and cannot be cracked or falsified.

【IPSOU can avoid centralization risks and high efficiency protection】
---------------------------------------------------------

Centralized management of centralized storage can be completely compromised by operational risk or hacking. Innovative governance model promotes the self-circulation of ecology.

【Data ownership and privacy protection】
---------------------------------------------------------

The user's identity and stored data/file content are hash-encrypted and the privacy leaks are better avoided within the system.
